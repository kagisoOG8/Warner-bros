       <h1>SUPERMAN & LOIS</h1><br>
	        <p><strong>SEASONS:</strong>THREE</p><br>
            <p><strong>Cast:<br></strong>Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Jordan Kent</p><br>
            <p><strong>Genre:<br></strong>Action/Adventure, Drama</p><br>
            <p><strong>About:</strong>Season three of SUPERMAN & LOIS opens weeks after Superman's blowout defeat of Ally Allston. 
			Clark (Hoechlin) and Lois (Tulloch) are now working at the Smallville Gazette together and enjoying small town life. 
			But the Kents' romantic bliss only shines a light on how isolating "the secret" can be, as Chrissy (Hasmik) struggles 
			to balance a new love interest and her friendship with Lois. However, Lois' own work-life balance is put to the test 
			when an undercover assignment reveals a deadly foe that promises to change the Kent family forever. Superman would move 
			heaven and earth for his family, but with a villain this merciless, even that might not be enough. Meanwhile, the Kent 
			boys find themselves being pulled in opposite directions as Jordan (Garfin) discovers what a superhero-identity really 
			means and Jonathan (Bishop) searches for purpose beyond the football field. Amid all this upheaval, John Henry (Parks) 
			is haunted by his doppelgänger's past, leading to dangerous consequences for him and Natalie (Buck). Lana Lang (Chriqui)
			and Kyle (Valdez) redefine their family post-separation, while Sarah (Navarrette) explores what the future holds for her
			and Jordan now that she knows the truth about his powers. Having learned the hard way that no one else can be trusted to 
			work with Superman, General Samuel Lane (Walsh) reclaims his post at the Department of Defense, only to face his own 
			conflict in working with his grandson, Jordan.</p><br>
